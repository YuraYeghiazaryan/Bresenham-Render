# Bresenham-Render
Bresenham-Render is a work-in-progress library for rendering shapes using the Bresenham algorithm. Designed to be context-independent, this project aims to provide an efficient and adaptable way to generate lines, circles, and other shapes in various environments, such as terminals, graphical UIs, or custom contexts.
